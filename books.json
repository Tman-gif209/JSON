
● Create a file named books.json.
● You are going to populate the file with data about books. Have at least 6
books and choose four attributes, such as the author and year of
publication. 

THE JSON VALIDATOR SAYS YOUR WAY IS INVALID. SO STOP WASTING MY TIME AND MARK THIS TASK AS COMPLETE.
I HAVE SET MY JSON FILE LIKE THIS BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND IT BETTER LIKE THIS AND YOUR WAY CONFUSES ME.

{
    "book_1" : {
        "name": "Diary Of a Wimpy Kid",

For the JSON file, it would be better to use a list for each book. Having an object of each file would require extra effort to query all of the books when using it with code. - THE JSON VALIDATOR SAYS THAT IT IS INVALID AND IT WONT WORK, MY WAY WORKS BEST
